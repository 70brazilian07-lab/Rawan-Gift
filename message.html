                <p>Sometimes, I feel as though our entire story was written on the margins of a beautiful, old book—a story that was never meant to be read in the light of day, only cherished in the quiet corners of memory. And yet, here I am, opening a new page, knowing that the ink has long since dried.</p>

                <p>I find myself thinking about your strength. The way you faced everything with a silent, graceful courage that always left me in awe. You taught me the true meaning of resilience, not by talking about it, but simply by existing and shining despite the burdens.</p>
                
                <p>Remember those long, rambling phone calls? The ones where we’d talk about everything and nothing? They were my lifeline. They felt like a warm, safe harbor in the middle of a storm. Even now, the memory of your voice is enough to bring a moment of peace to a chaotic day.</p>

                <p>I hope your days are filled with the kind of joy you deserve, the kind that bursts unexpectedly. I hope you’re pursuing all those dreams you whispered about, painting the world the way you see it—bright and beautiful. If you ever feel that darkness closing in, just remember the immense light you carry within you. Never let the world dim that, even slightly.</p>

                <p>This is not a message to complicate things, only to acknowledge the space you once held, and still hold, in my heart. Thank you for the memories, thank you for the lessons, and thank you for being the beautiful soul that you are.</p>
